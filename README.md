# CP Language
CP is a toy programming language developed for fun.

## Features

## Getting Started

### Installation
To use CP, follow these steps:
1. Download the release interpreter
2. Navigate to the CP directory
3. Execute CP interpreter by running the following command: `./cp main.cp`

### Hello, World!
Here's a classic "Hello, World!" program in CP:

```cp
print("Hello, World!");
```

Save this code in a file with a `.cp` extension, for example, `hello.cp`. Then, run it using the CP interpreter:

```bash
$ ./cp  hello.cp
```

You should see the output:

```
Hello, World!
```
