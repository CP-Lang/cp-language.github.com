## Getting Started

### Installation
To use Flexa, follow these steps:
1. Download the interpreter [release](https://github.com/flexa-script/interpreter)
2. Navigate to the Flexa directory
3. Execute Flexa interpreter by running the following command: `./flexa main.flx`

### Hello, World!
Here's a classic "Hello, World!" program in Flexa:

```flx
print("Hello, World!");
```

Save this code in a file with a `.flx` extension, for example, `hello.flx`. Then, run it using the Flexa interpreter:

```bash
$ ./flexa  hello.flx
```

You should see the output:

```
Hello, World!
```
